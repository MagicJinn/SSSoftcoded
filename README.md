# Sunless Sea: Softcoded

A Sunless Sea [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) mod that opens previously inaccessible resource types up to traditional modding techniques.

### Installation

Download a release. Extract the contents of the SSSoftcoded folder in the zip into your base Sunless Sea folder. On Steam this should be steamapps/common/SunlessSea. It will be something similar on GOG/Epic etc.

This mod will not do anything if you don't then install additional custom content. Details on how to do this, as well as documentation of what files in the game can be replaced via this mod, are included in the pdf enclosed in the release.
